**The Fall of Faerdya**

Millennia ago, the world was in chaos. Three factions battled for control of the land, Faerdya:
    1. Demons,
    2. Gods, 
    3. Engineers,

The Gods and Engineers had grown weary of their forced compliance. For generations, they had appeased the demons with constant human sacrifices, desperately hoping to maintain an uneasy peace. Finally, they decided to break the treaty and rebel.

Devastation spread everywhere—cities crumbled, states fell, nations collapsed, and entire continents were reduced to ash. The world became an apocalyptic wasteland.

The Demons grew stronger by devouring the souls of fallen Gods and Engineers. They were winning. Meanwhile, the Gods and Engineers remained bitter enemies—the Engineers, beloved by the people for their innovations and progress, despised how the Gods enslaved mortals through deception, forcing worship to steal their soul energy. This divine manipulation drained people of their psychic abilities and mental growth, everything the Engineers sought to enhance.

Even as demons exploited their division, neither faction could set aside their hatred long enough to unite against the common threat.

The Engineers and Gods finally realized, after watching their capitals fall and their forces get slaughtered, that they needed to work together against the demons. 

During a crucial battle, the Engineers managed to temporarily weaken the demons through their advanced technology. Seeing their opportunity, the Gods struck—but not at the demons. Instead, they turned on the exhausted Engineers, using the chaos to enslave the survivors and force them into worship.

With both Engineer technology and divine soul power now at their disposal, the Gods became a hybrid force. They infused their god-given abilities with captured Engineer innovations, creating devastating new weapons. The demons, still recovering from the Engineer assault, found themselves facing an enemy that combined technological prowess and soul-draining divine power.

The enslaved Engineers, now drained of their soul energy through forced worship, became mere shadows of their former brilliance. Once the most innovative minds in Faerdya, they could barely maintain the technologies they had created, let alone improve them. The Gods had gained power, but at the cost of the very ingenuity that made their victory possible.

**The Last Engineer**

In the final hours before the Engineer civilization fell, its leaders—knowing their people's fate was sealed—performed one last act of defiance. They created a dimensional storage device and gifted their child with the ability to shapeshift, hoping these tools would allow the last of their kind to survive in a world torn apart by war.

Now, millennia later, their descendant wanders the wasteland of Faerdya as the last living Engineer. Armed with an ancient inventory system that can store weapons from any faction, and blessed with shapeshifting abilities that allow him to wield both DEMON and GOD gear without being destroyed by their conflicting energies, he walks among the ruins of three civilizations.

He carries demon blades that grow stronger with each soul claimed, holy shields that draw power from those who would worship him, and the fading hope that somewhere in this broken world, the balance his ancestors dreamed of might still be restored.
